title: Supporting COVID Research: Rapid Reviews on Sysrev

Over the course of two months, a multinational team used Sysrev to
assess the clinical characteristics and the risk factors associated with
SARS CoV2 in patients with Chronic Kidney Disease.  

Researchers from the UK and China performed a two-stage review of 476
documents, as well as a ROBINS-I Risk assessment.  EDIT: The results of
this review have been published: [COVID-19 and kidney transplantation: A
systematic
review](https://www.kireports.org/article/S2468-0249(20)31693-4/fulltext).

This story begins in late March when we decided to
[fund](https://blog.sysrev.com/mini-grants/) a COVID based research
project.  Around that time, I noticed that Dr. Ciara Keenan (Associate
Director of Cochrane Ireland and a research fellow for Campbell UK and
Ireland) had created a COVID Mapping project on Sysrev.  As I had
followed Dr. Keenan for some time (check out her twitter
[@MetaEvidence](https://twitter.com/metaevidence)!), I was excited to
see how we may help.  After some discussion, Sysrev offered to finance a
COVID-focused project of her choosing.

Within a few days, Dr. Keenan had put together a multi-national team
headed by Dr. Damian Fogarty, senior nephrologist in the Belfast Health
and Social Care Trust.

**ABSTRACT SCREENING** ([Project
29506](https://sysrev.com/u/249/p/29506))

The research team screened 476 abstracts for inclusion / exclusion.  The
abstracts were uploaded into Sysrev via two XMLs.  One XML consisted of
entirely English abstracts, while the other contained Chinese abstracts.
 As Sysrev allows users to sort based on import file, this allowed the
multi-national team to focus on the publications in their primary
language.

*Dr. Keenan: "Setting up the project was very easy. I had deduplicated
all references in my endnote library, as usual, and then was able to
import the remaining references as an XML format directly to Sysrev."*

As you can see in the [Project
Description](https://sysrev.com/u/249/p/29506), the Rapid Review’s
protocol had strict inclusion / exclusion guidelines.  To help guide the
reviewers, Dr. Keenan constructed labels that translated the
requirements into a series of Yes – No (Maybe) questions.  In this way,
it is easier to visualize the logic progression and spot any errors.  

*Dr. Keenan: "When creating the labels I was able to input brief
explanations which the users could see if they hovered over the question
mark symbol. "*

</figure>

Setting the labels up in this way saved substantial time.  Only 20 of
the 476 articles resulted in Conflicts – that is, the reviewers
disagreed on whether the article should be included.  In the end, 31
articles were included.

*Dr. Keenan "From a project management perspective, I found it
invaluable that you can track reviewers progress in real time. When I
have managed systematic review projects in the past, I have provided
batches of references to reviewers and it just isn’t possible to tell if
they have started the batch, finished the batch, or are stuck, but with
SysRev I was able to check in with the reviewers as they progressed and
that really helped moved the project on quickly."*

**Full-Text (PDF) Data Extraction** ([Project
29629](https://sysrev.com/u/249/p/29629))

To start the Data Extraction phase, Dr. Keenan once again [uploaded two
XML’s](https://sysrev.com/u/249/p/29629/add-articles), one for each
language.  She then uploaded full PDF documents to each article within
Sysrev.  For copyright reasons, Sysrev does not render PDFs to
non-project members.  

The goal of the data extraction phase was to pull out a number of study
details, including study design, participant details, interventions, and
outcomes.  To capture all of the intended labels, Dr. Keenan created [29
labels](https://sysrev.com/u/249/p/29629/labels/edit).  By selecting
[Display Options –
Labels](https://sysrev.com/u/249/p/29629/articles?offset=0&sort-by=content-updated&sort-dir=desc&display=%7B%22show-labels%22%3Atrue%7D)
in the Articles page, you can see all of the data extracted for each
document.  In the end, over 700 pieces of information were extracted.

*Dr. Mahalingasivam: \[Sysrev\] very easy to use... the notes function
was very useful and it was easy to go back and correct responses if
mistakes were made.*

**ROBINS – I Assessment Tool** ([Project
30488](https://sysrev.com/u/249/p/30488))

As a final step, the review team conducted a ROBINS-I Risk of Bias
Assessment.  To learn more about the ROBINS-I tool, check out [this
publication](https://www.bmj.com/content/bmj/355/bmj.i4919.full.pdf).
 Dr. Keenan translated the inferences of the tool into [six
labels](https://sysrev.com/u/249/p/30488/labels/edit), one for each
potential source of bias.  Reviewers then classified each article’s
potential for that bias as Critical, Moderate, Serious or Low.

We appreciate Dr. Keenan and her team’s devotion to their work and we
are proud to have supported this effort.  We look forward to seeing the
resulting publications, as well as their future work.  If you have an
open science project that you would benefit from funding, apply to our
future Mini-Grants.  

**Sysrev Mini-Grants**

Sysrev supports academic research by providing a platform for free
open-access projects.  In addition, Sysrev offers
**[Mini-Grants](https://blog.sysrev.com/mini-grants/)** for open science
projects.  Using Sysrev's built-in compensation tool, Mini-Grant winners
are able to pay their reviewers on a per-document basis.  In this way,
Sysrev provides funding to the research team for their otherwise
*pro-bono* work.  

*Dr. Keenan: "The compensation feature was excellent. I was able to
deposit the funds into the reviewers PayPal account as soon as they had
completed the task, instant reimbursement!"*
