title: Sysrev: A Powerful Covidence Replacement - Part 2: Feature Comparison
description: Sysrev provides more functionality than Covidence - at a fraction of the price.  Part 2 - Feature Comparison
---
Sysrev matches and exceeds Covidence's review capabilities.

As [**Part 1**](https://blog.sysrev.com/sysrev-covidence-part1/) of this
blog showed, Sysrev is a cheaper alternative to Covidence, that
facilitates both rigorous and more generalized document reviews, and has
unique research support capabilities.

Part 2 will focus on specific features of Covidence as a review platform
and the Sysrev analogs.  As you will see, Sysrev is also a strong
alternative for features Covidence supports like **import**, **screening
and extraction** and **analytics & exporting**.

**Importing**

Covidence allows references to be imported using either EndNote or
Pubmed XML format, as well as text documents in RAS or CSR formatting.  

Sysrev also permits references to be imported via XML file.  Sysrev
users can also use an in-application Pubmed Search to query for
articles, import specific articles by PMIDs, or upload a .zip of PDFs.
 The ability to batch upload PDFs greatly increases the versatility of
Sysrev.  In addition to publications, projects can focus on technical
sheets such as MSDS, reporting documents, patents, or any number of
possibilities.  
  
*Update Nov: 11th* - Sysrev now supports import using the [RIS file
type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS_(file_format)), which is
supported by many reference and citation managers.  Learn more at
<https://blog.sysrev.com/ris-import-support/>

For projects that involve a continuous review of new documents, Sysrev
can integrate custom data sources (e.g. clinicaltrials.gov).  Contact us

**Screening and Extraction**

Covidence assumes a two part screening process – a first pass of just
Title & Abstracts and then a second review of the full article – before
a final Extraction step.  Each "task" within the review can be completed
by 1 or 2 reviewers.  Tasks are assigned randomly.

For Title and Abstract screening, users are able to select yes, no, or
maybe, while Full Article screening requires a final include or exclude
designation.  Users are able to add inclusion/exclusion criteria, as
well as highlights, tags, and notes which help the reviewers in their
decision marking process.  

The Extraction phase is where Covidence is both the most developed and
the most limited.  As a part of the extraction phase, each Covidence
review has a pre-built "Quality Assessment" dashboard which asks the
reviewers to look for red flags associated with bias, as well as
incomplete or selective data, that may be associated with individual
studies.  

The actual Data Extraction dashboard includes a number of data
categories: Summary, Identification, Methods, Population, Interventions,
and Outcomes.  Within each category, the user can create any number of
data points for the reviewers to extract within the pre-built scenarios.
 

Alternatively, Sysrev users are able to screen and perform data
extraction within the same step.  As opposed to Covidence where
inclusion/exclusion criteria are simply listed as reminders at the top
of the review dashboard, Sysrev allows for inclusion criteria to be
"hard-coded" into labels.  That is, the Project Admins can create labels
which are required for a document to be included, decreasing the chance
of mis-labeling.  

For the actual data extraction, Sysrev users can create as many boolean,
string, or category labels as they choose – providing true flexibility
in screening and extraction tasks.

**Analytics & Export**

Sysrev gives unparalleled insight into the progress of each *Project.
 *For each article, Sysrev tracks every label applied by every reviewer,
including conflict resolutions. Unlike Covidence which [does not
allow](https://support.covidence.org/help/can-i-export-voting-history-slash-records-of-conflicts)
voting histories to be exported, Sysrev has a number of Export
functionalities including exporting individual answers.  This is
especially important as Sysrev permits the scenario where every reviewer
reviews every document.   Along with tracking pure progress, Sysrev also
calculates a [concordance
metric](https://blog.sysrev.com/user-inclusion-concordance/) to give
insight into each reviewer's performance.

**Artificial Intelligence - Predicting Inclusion**

Within each project, Sysrev attempts to learn from the reviewers which
of the uploaded documents meeting inclusion criteria.  In fact, Sysrev
chooses the order in which documents are reviewed so that it can learn
the inclusion/exclusion criteria as quickly as possible.  At their own
discretion, Sysrev users can filter articles based on the
inclusion/exclusion predictions.

In conclusion, Covidence is a mature platform which expects reviews to
be conducted in a very pre-defined way.  Conversely, Sysrev was built
with flexibility in mind – any extraction task on any document.  It is
by that flexibility that Sysrev is not only a viable alternative, but a
powerful (and much cheaper) replacement for Covidence.
