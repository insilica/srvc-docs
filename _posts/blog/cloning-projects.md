The ability to clone projects makes it easy to review shared data
sources, create templates, and streamline workflows.

Each project has a `clone` button in the upper right.  Clicking `clone`
will copy an existing project's articles and labels definitions into a
new project.  After cloning a project, users can modify (or add to) the
cloned label definitions and/or data sources.  

**Reviewing shared data sources**  
Cloning simplifies the process of conducting multiple reviews of the
same source data. [Sysrev.com/p/27275](sysrev.com/p/p/27275) is a review
of the Covid-19 data set (CORD-19) created by the [Chan Zuckerberg
Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/covid-19/), [National
Library of Medicine](https://www.nlm.nih.gov/), [Allen
AI](https://pages.semanticscholar.org/coronavirus-research),
[Microsoft](https://news.microsoft.com/covid-19-response/) and
[Georgetown
University](https://cset.georgetown.edu/covid-19-open-research-dataset-cord-19/).
  This data set includes titles, abstracts, and full text from 8146
documents.  Users can create their own review of this data set by simply
hitting the clone button.

**Creation of template reviews**  
Cloning also makes it possible to create 'template' reviews, wherein the
same labels are re-used in downstream projects.

The [GESI](https://gesi.org/) group used cloning to create [8
projects](https://sysrev.com/search?q=humanitarian&p=1&type=projects) on
humanitarian conflict. By cloning projects it is possible to maintain a
consistent set of labels.  This is useful if you want separate projects
to focus on the same data extraction tasks.

Finally, cloning is useful to organizations who use Sysrev as a part of
their own consulting or research services. The [Sustainable Research
Group](https://sustainableresearchgroup.com/) (SRG) helps their clients
with chemical regulatory needs.  As part of this service, they conduct
standardized reviews of forms called safety data sheets.  By cloning
their own (private) project template, SRG is able to show clients
exactly what end-product deliverables will look like before work is even
started.  Cloning also increases the ease at which SRG is able to
[conduct multiple remote projects
simultaneously](https://blog.sysrev.com/srg-sysrev-chemical-transparency/).
