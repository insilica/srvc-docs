Microsoft Excel, and its many derivatives (Google Sheets, Numbers etc)
are amazing programs.  Regardless of one’s own technical expertise,
spreadsheet programs offer a near limitless ability to organize and
analyze data, especially when one considers how many programs and
languages can interact with .csv files.  However, despite their many
uses...

**Spreadsheet programs are NOT suited for document review tasks.**

The simplest reason why is user error.  When reviewing tens or hundreds
or thousands of documents, it is extremely difficult to keep all of the
meta-data and extracted data synced.  This is especially true when
managing teams of multiple reviewers.  Ensuring that everyone follows
the same standards and protocols is simply too cumbersome to manage.

Fortunately, where spreadsheets are insufficient, Sysrev *excels*.
 Sysrev helps organizations manage, and optimize, document review tasks.
  Moreover, Sysrev feature set allows unparalleled flexibility in review
types.

**Extract**: Each Project on Sysrev can have an unlimited number of
“Label Definitions.”  These labels allow the project manager to loosely
or precisely define which types of data should be extracted from each
document.  Designating a label as “inclusion criteria” adds another
level of clarity to both reviewers and those analyzing the data.

**Audit**:  Unlike other solutions, Sysrev records every task by every
reviewer on every document.  At any time, project managers can see which
documents were reviewed by which personnel and which labels were
assigned by each reviewer.   Project managers are also able to review
and resolve any conflicts between reviewers.

**Export**: Admittedly, once the review is done, there may be a need to
analyze the data within a spreadsheet program.  Not to worry, Sysrev
easily exports to .csv.  Users are able to customize each export to suit
their needs.

**Customization and Optimization**:  There are many use-cases where an
organization may want their data in a specific format.  Contact us to
learn more about tailoring Sysrev to your specific needs or to learn
more about automating with machine learning.
