In the 2020-21 academic year, Sysrev helped teach students in the Public
Health Toxicology and Environmental Health courses at The Johns Hopkins
University Bloomberg School of Public Health.  At the end of the year
95% of students reported that they would recommend Sysrev to other
classrooms.

**Fall 2020 - Public Health Toxicology**

In the Public Health Toxicology course, students were assigned to groups
to evaluate drug induced liver injury in rats, cell apoptosis response
to cadmium exposure, and DNA damage in lung tissue exposed to
particulate matter.

In Part 1 of the assignment, students reviewed papers individually and
answered topic specific questions within each paper.  In Part 2, student
groups discussed papers and compared answers to generate a summary
briefing of their findings.

Students reported that this portion of the course taught them a new
skill.  The professor, Dr. Joseph Bressler, expressed that:

> The main takeaway we had as instructors, through our use of Sysrev in
> class, was that students learned a valuable skill. I kept seeing that
> word pop up in course evaluations—‘skill’—and knew that we were
> successfully teaching students the skill of systematic review through
> the platform. - Joseph Bressler Associate Professor Johns Hopkins
> School of Public Health

Sysrev aided in classroom management in this project. The TAs were able
to create a template project for each assignment and then clone the
template for each student group. Sysrev helped TAs to manage projects
and track completion.  

**Spring 2021 - Environmental Health**

In the Environmental Health course, 130 students were asked to perform a
'mini' systematic review with the aim to answer: "**Do imported meat
products elevate the risk of consumer contact with antibiotic resistant
bacteria?"**

Students reviewed for relevant articles from PubMed and identified
referenced meats, bacteria, antibacterials, import source location,
retail environment,  and the experimental methods used to evaluate
antibiotic resistance.

All Students in the classroom participated in one very large project and
extracted bacteria, antibacterials, etc. in a controlled fashion.  The
data may allow researchers to examine interesting correlations between
extracted entities.

In this project, project administrators created many labels, which
correspond to questions like "which antibiotic was used?".  Students
then reviewed documents and identified label answers from each document.
 In this way, students were able to learn how the basic concepts, such
as different types of bacteria, are researched in real world documents.
 

**Student Evaluation**

When asked to evaluate the platform, **95% of students recommended other
classes use Sysrev**. Most importantly, not only did the students find
the platform intuitive and easy-to-use, they recognized that the
processes and skills they were learning mirror those used by career
scientists.

> I was completely unfamiliar with systematic reviews… working with
> Sysrev was a good introduction to all of that. It also taught me how
> to sift through large amounts of information quickly - AK

> Since Sysrev optimizes the review process with machine learning, it
> added efficiency through its intuitive, and collaborative interface.
> There are thousands of articles that pop up during research, but
> Sysrev makes it convenient by predicting which articles are relevant,
> thus saving researchers countless hours. - SK

> Regardless of what academic venture I’m participating in for the
> future, Sysrev will be a useful tool. - A. Kim

Sysrev has a place in any classroom that involves understanding publicly
available documents.  While not used in this classroom, Sysrev
integrations with the programming languages R and python allow students
and researchers to easily do analysis on extracted data.

**Instructor Evaluation**

In addition to their emphasis on teaching practical skills, Professor
Bressler and the courses’ TAs expressed other benefits of utilizing the
Sysrev platform.

Built for collaborative research, Sysrev was well suited for the
group-work aspects of the Public Health Toxicology course. With *Project
Cloning* and *Sysrev Concordance,* the course organizers were able to
quickly create, assign, and grade tasks for each student group. While
the Environmental Health course used Sysrev for individual assignments,
*Sysrev Concordance* still facilitated automated grading for over 130
students extraction tables.

Last but not least, Sysrev successfully facilitated the teaching of
systematic review methodology during a year of remote-learning. Remote
learning was a benefit that was recognized by students as well:

> The platform itself was user friendly, and lent itself to increased
> group collaboration, especially in a virtual environment. - SZ

**Engage students with meaningful research**

Sysrev is used for a variety of academic purposes, by professors,
researchers, students, and librarians.

The first Sysrev user webinar included medical research project
presentations by Dr. Elizabeth Wayne at Carnegie Mellon, Dr. Nasir Mirza
at University of Liverpool, and Dr. Channing Paller at Johns Hopkins
school of Medicine
([youtube)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLt4D0fZLWzSlfp5Ev4OIdtIPi2rwfopJb).
  Many of these project leaders have expressed an **unintended
educational benefit of incorporating students into their Sysrev
projects**. We encourage this practice and would gladly help guide any
academic researcher who would like to explore incorporating student
reviewers.  
  
In addition to this type of supplementary educational benefit, we now
have examples of Sysrev being used specifically **as an educational
tool.** As said eloquently by Dr. Bressler, **the greatest benefit of
using Sysrev as an educational tool is that Sysrev IS a research tool**.
What better way to learn systematic review and evidence-based
methodologies than by performing a literature review in a systematic
fashion.

**Sysrev in your classroom**

Sysrev is dedicated to open-access and FAIR (Findable, Accessible,
Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. Public projects, which are
discoverable by anybody on the internet ([read
more](https://github.com/sysrev/Sysrev_Documentation/wiki/What-is-Sysrev%3F#projects-public-and-private)),
are and will always be free on Sysrev.

Understandably, there are instances where educators may wish their
research, assignments, or students to remain private. In these
instances, we recommend individual professors and departments sign up
for **[Premium](sysrev.com/pricing)** accounts. This type of account
will allow for each instructor and TA to have admin account with the
ability to create projects (assignments) and manage students.  

**Sysrev in your university**

Sysrev offers university-wide enterprise accounts that make it easy for
researchers, students, or professors in a university to create projects
and teams, and share their data.  Email us at <info@sysrev.com> to learn
more about our enterprise licenses.  
  
University Specific Benefits include:

-   **University Wide Verification:** Premium Accounts for every user
