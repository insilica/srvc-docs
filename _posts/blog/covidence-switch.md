title: Making The Switch From Covidence
description: making-the-switch

Researchers are making the switch to Sysrev for document review.  

In a recent survey, 95% of students said they would recommend Sysrev
([link](https://blog.sysrev.com/sysrev-in-the-classroom/)). Still, many
universities have a hard time making the switch. Why?

The Covidence platform has aggressively licensed at universities and
stretching a library budget over two platforms is hard, even if users
like a new platform more.  

So we're going to help out.  If your library or university already has a
Covidence license, we will provide Sysrev Premium for free, for your
entire university, for the remaining duration of your Covidence license.
Seriously.

Software shouldn't hold you hostage. Try Sysrev, your team will be happy
you did.  

This offer is available on a first come first serve basis. <span
