title: Which Genes Matter? Putting NER To Use

A wealth of medical knowledge is locked away in millions of academic
articles. If Natural Language Processing is the key to unlocking it,
literature reviews are the key-makers.  

This post will show how data obtained from literature reviews can
seamlessly inform both models and actionable applications – using the
real world examples of the [Gene Hunter
Project](https://sysrev.com/p/3144).

When exploring medical literature, it's helpful to have a goal.  In the
case of the [Gene Hunter Project](https://sysrev.com/p/3144), our goal
was to automatically correlate specific genes with specific medical
terms.  Step one was to create the *training data*.  Using Sysrev,
reviewers were paid $0.50 per-task to read medical abstracts and
identify genes.  Paid reviewers completed 10,000 sentences in just two
weeks.

Epigenetic Silencing of the mutL homolog 1 ( <span class="mark entity"
style="background: #ddd; padding: 0.05em 0.15em; margin: 0 0.05em; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.15em; box-decoration-break: clone; -webkit-box-decoration-break: clone">
MLH1 <span
style="font-size: 0.8em; font-weight: bold; line-height: 1; border-radius: 0.35em; text-transform: uppercase; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 0.5rem">GENE</span>
</span> ) Promoter in Relation to the Development of Gastric Cancer (GC)
and its use as a Biomarker for Patients with Microsatellite Instability.

An example gene annotation visualized using [spaCy
visualizers](https://spacy.io/usage/visualizers). Reviewers at
sysrev.com/p/3144 were asked to identify genes in medical abstracts.

  

As all of annotation data generated by the reviewers is open access, it
can easily be used to train text annotation models.  If you are
interested, [this blog post](blog.sysrev.com/simple-ner) describes how
to build gene annotation models in under 10 minutes using the [Gene
Hunter Project](sysrev.com/p/3144) data.  By giving our users 100%
flexibility in defining their labels (thereby customizing the resulting
exported database), we hope to support many machine learning projects.

Back to our example – by running the NER models on
[PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) medical queries, gene
counts can be associated with medical concepts.  Put another way, we can
see which genes are most statistically 'relevant' to any given medical
term.  We've implemented this process into our toy application:
 [WhichGenesMatter.com](http://Whichgenesmatter.com).  Simply type in a
medical query and see which genes are detected in the resulting
abstracts.

One of my favorite medical topics is longevity.  Lets see if we're
picking up the right genes for aging:

These don't look bad, in fact many of these genes are mentioned in
Cynthia Kenyon's ([calicolabs.com](https://www.calicolabs.com)) awesome
