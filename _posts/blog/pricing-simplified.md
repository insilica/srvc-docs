**Sysrev *BASIC***  
Sysrev's free ***Basic*** subscription is completely unchanged.  
- ***Basic*** *Labels*: Boolean, Categorical, String, & Annotation*.*  
- Create ***Basic*** *Organizations*  
- Unlimited Open Access *Public* Projects  
- Unlimited Reviewers  
- Unlimited Articles

Our most popular subscription, Sysrev ***Basic*** includes everything
researchers need to perform the majority of literature reviews. Sysrev
***Basic*** *Users* can create unlimited *Public* **** (open to the
public) projects and invite as many reviewers as they need.  
  
Sysrev ***Basic** Users* can also create ***Basic** Organizations* or
teams*. Organizations* facilitate easier collaboration across projects
by automatically extending administration capabilities to its members.
Like the ***Basic** User*, ***Basic** Organizations* **** can utilize
***Basic** Labels*, create unlimited *Public* projects, and invite
unlimited reviewers.

**Sysrev *PREMIUM***  
- Sysrev ***BASIC+***  
- Create ***Premium*** *Organizations*  
- Unlimited *Private* and *Public* Projects  
- ***Premium*** Features: [*Group*
*Labels*](https://youtu.be/3FzJIXGOXq0), [Label Counts, &
Concordance](https://youtu.be/FgxJ4zTVUn4)  
- Developer Tool Access: [RSysrev](https://github.com/sysrev/RSysrev) &
[PySysrev](https://github.com/sysrev/PySysrev)  
  
Sysrev **Premium** *Users* can create unlimited *Private* (hidden) and
*Public* projects and have access to all of Sysrev advanced features.

**Premium** accounts can also create ***Premium*** *Organizations.*
Every member of a ***Premium*** *Organization * has access to all Sysrev
***Premium*** features, can create unlimited *Public* and *Private*
projects for the *Organization,* and has full administrator rights to
all of the *Organization's* projects.  
  
Just like before, the price of a ***Premium*** *Organization* is based
on the number of **members** across your *Organizations*, NOT on the
number of reviewers in your projects.  
  
That means that if you are a professor working with two post-docs and a
rotating team of graduate students, you can create an *Organization*
with three members to manage your literature reviews, create as many
*Private* or *Public* projects as you need, and invite ALL  of your
graduate students to help perform the actual work for just $30
USD/month.

**Sysrev *ENTERPRISE***  
Sysrev ***Enterprise*** provides ***Premium*** accounts to all *Users*
at your institution.  We additionally provide (and build custom)
enterprise reporting and management tools for users at your institution.
All ***Enterprise*** accounts receive customer and support. Pricing is
based on the total number of users at your institution and an hourly for
support.

That's it! Our previous account types were a bit too complicated and we
hope that this simplification will help you get the most out of Sysrev.
