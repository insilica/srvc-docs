title: Sysrev "Proof of Review" - How to demonstrate innovation in a grant or paper
description: sysrev-proof-of-review

Precedence is a powerful human motivator, but how do you prove you are
first?

Innovation is a key criteria in the evaluation of new work.  Why do
something if it has already been done?  Today, the internet, patent, and
entire academic system support the notion of precedence.  But even now
big disputes break out over who was first. The gene editing CRISPR
technology is a fascinating example [\[1\]](#references).

In NIH grants, innovation is a major category. Being able to establish
precedence can mean the difference between success and failure on your
next proposal.  It is useful to say "nobody has ever tried this method
before."  But most reviewers won't take your word for it.  So how do you
<u>prove</u> that you are the first?  

Sysrev open access projects allow you to share your search and prove
that you have reviewed the relevant literature.  Grant reviewers can
easily look at your review, evaluate your search criteria, and confirm
that you evaluated the resulting articles. They can even randomly check
your actual review process and confirm to some degree of confidence that
claims of precedence are correct.

We did this recently for a grant applying advanced machine learning
approaches to cancer survival modeling.  In our short review we actually
found 2 publications already implementing many of the same ideas, albeit
on a slightly different datasets [\[2,3\]](#references).  Because the
project is open access we shared the url in our grant and our reviewers
could easily confirm that the idea was somewhat novel and that we had
evaluated many of the pertinent examples.    
  
If you want to prove that you reviewed the literature for your next
grant or paper an open access sysrev might work for you.  Getting
started takes less than 5 minutes
([blog.sysrev.com/getting-started](https://blog.sysrev.com/getting-started/)).
The success of your next project might depend on it!
