We are offering $1000 to informationists and librarians at American
Universities to try out Sysrev.  They can use the money for anything
they like and at the end of the 6 months we will provide a simple survey
and ask that participating libraries consider using using Sysrev for
their document review needs.

Additionally, we are temporarily offering 2 year licenses of sysrev for
$1200 per year to university libraries.  This license will allow
libraries to use Sysrev with up to 100 users and represents a 90%
discount on the regular sysrev pricing.
