title: Open Source Labels

Sysrev recently enabled 'shared' labels.  When you create a sysrev
project, you can import labels created in other projects or found on
labels.sysrev.com.  We think this is a pretty big deal, let me tell you
why.

Open source software projects allow the public to contribute to and/or
copy the underlying code base.  Many important software projects are
open source.  

Sysrev's shared labels bring the concept of open source code to document
review.

This means that anybody can create a new label and host it on
labels.sysrev.com. Labels can be modified and versioned, which means you
can start with a good idea for a label and improve it over time, without
disrupting your downstream users.

**Reducing redundancy**  
Shared labels enable a lot of super powers.  When users agree that they
are using the same label in different projects, then redundant work can
be reduced.  

**Learnable Labels**  
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where models are
created to 'classify' digital entities.  Creating supervised learning
models usually requires a large annotated corpus, often created by
humans assigning labels to entities.

Shared labels allows sysrev to build machine learning models that span
multiple projects.  If you create a label that identifies genes in text,
and a successful sysrev model is created from that

**Search Index**  
The NCBI takes on many large projects to make PubMed a more and more
useful tool.  They have their very own special 'shared' labels in the
form of mesh terms, article attributes, and article types, which can be
used to create and filter PubMed searches. For example, PubMed allows
you to filter down to publications with the article type 'clinical
trial'.  

I don't know how PubMed maintains their labels, but popular open source
labels that have been assigned to enough documents, or accurately
modeled can be used as search indexes for future reviews.
