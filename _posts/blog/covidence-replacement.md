Sysrev provides more functionality than Covidence - at a fraction of the
price.

## Pricing

**Sysrev is and will always be free for Public Projects***.* Public
Projects are [completely
transparent](https://blog.sysrev.com/fair-review/) reviews with
findable, dedicated URLs that anybody can access (see a [prostate cancer
 review example](https://sysrev.com/p/844)).  

Sysrev supports private projects. **[PRO](https://sysrev.com/pricing)**
users can create <u>unlimited</u> private projects for $10/month.
**[Team Pro](https://sysrev.com/pricing) ** allows teams to manage
reviews together for $30/month. All private projects allow an unlimited
number of reviewers.

Covidence charges per review: $240 for one or $445 for three. Each
Covidence review can also have an unlimited number of reviewers.  

If you want to easily create dozens or hundreds of reviews Sysrev is the
only reasonable option.  Sysrev user
"r[oneal](https://sysrev.com/user/736/projects)" has created 22 public
projects - all for free. The math is simple. Sysrev is cheaper.

## Traditional Systematic Review

Sysrev is an incredibly flexible review platform. Almost everything
Covidence does can be done on Sysrev.  To see a more detailed
side-by-side feature comparison, check out [**Part
2**](https://blog.sysrev.com/sysrev-covidence-part2/) of this blog post.
 

While we think Sysrev is always the stronger choice, if you are a
Cochrane volunteer doing Cochrane style reviews you may want to stick
with Covidence – which is the Cochrane supported application.  

## Generalized Document Review

If you want to apply the systematic review process to a collection of
non-academic articles Sysrev is a good choice.  You can create a review
of any collection of PDFs by uploading a zip file.  Our
[wiki](https://github.com/sysrev/Sysrev_Documentation/wiki/Importing-Literature-Into-Your-Project#PDF)
describes this in more detail.  Companies like SRG use pdf reviews to
review [safety data sheets](https://sysrev.com/p/4047) (PDFs with data
about chemical hazards).

## Open Access Review

Sysrev is the only platform offering truly open access reviews like the
[NIEHS Cancer Hallmarks Review](https://sysrev.com/p/3588).  Researchers
make their work more discoverable by creating free public - open access
- Sysrev projects.

Public entities benefit from open access review by keeping their work
more transparent and accessible to the public.  

## Machine Learning

Sysrev is built around machine learning.  It aims to better integrate
human and artificial intelligence.  Sysrev models already influence
hundreds of public reviews.  Additionally, data generated during a
Sysrev can be used to build your own machine learning models.  There is
a tutorial for this at
[blog.sysrev.com/simple-ner](https://blog.sysrev.com/simple-ner).

about Sysrev's machine learning capabilities.  

## Analytics Dashboard

Sysrev is rapidly developing an analytics dashboard to help project
administrators gain insight into any potential issues with their
reviewers or protocols.  You need an account to access it - but the
dashboard is currently available for all public projects and is
described in another blog post -
[blog.sysrev.com/user-inclusion-concordance/](https://blog.sysrev.com/user-inclusion-concordance/).

## Accessible Auditing

Every reviewed article can be referenced with a link.  View an example
from the Johns Hopkins liver effects project -
[link](https://sysrev.com/p/100/article/41072).

<figure>
<img src="https://sysrev-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/_posts/blog/content/images/2019/08/image-17.png" class="kg-image" alt="An auditable link from the public Hopkins liver effects review - sysrev.com/p/100/article/41072" /><figcaption aria-hidden="true">An auditable link from the public Hopkins liver effects review - <a href="https://sysrev.com/p/100/article/41072">sysrev.com/p/100/article/41072</a></figcaption>
</figure>

Linking to reviewed articles is an important part of auditing.  Simply
share a link to see who reviewed which article, when they reviewed it,
and what data was extracted. Links can also be used to view a subset of
articles.  For example, [this
link](https://sysrev.com/p/100/articles?offset=0&sort-by=content-updated&sort-dir=desc&filters=%5B%7B%22consensus%22%3A%7B%22status%22%3A%22determined%22%2C%22inclusion%22%3Atrue%7D%7D%5D)
shows all the 615 articles included in the Johns Hopkins liver toxicity
review.  

## API Integration

Sysrev is built for easy integration into other analytics programs.
 Check out our github repos for python and R clients.
 [Blog.sysrev.com/simple-ner](https://blog.sysrev.com/simple-ner) shows
how Sysrev APIs can be used to build your own natural language
processing models.  

## Part 2 - Side-by-side Feature Comparison

As this post has shown, Sysrev is a powerful platform with many unique
capabilities purposefully designed to help researchers conduct a wide
variety of reviews.  To see a deeper dive into specific searching,
screening, and extracting functionalities, check out [**Part
