</tr></tbody></table><p>The Analytics Dashboard: Concordance Tool was released today.  The Concordance Tool provides insight into reviewer agreement and label consistency.  This post will give an overview of the Concordance Tool with real data from the <a href="https://sysrev.com/o/2/p/21696" class="external-link">Mangiferin Data Extraction</a> project.  </p>

<p>The Analytics Dashboard is only available to project Administrators with a <strong>Pro</strong> or <strong>Team Pro</strong> subscription.  Contact us at <a href="mailto:info@sysrev.com" class="email">info@sysrev.com</a> to learn more.  An interactive demo of the Concordance Tool can be found <a href="https://blog.sysrev.com/ghost/Sysrev.com/p/21696/analytics/concordance">here</a>.  </p>
<p>The Concordance Tool consists of an overall <strong>Concordance Score</strong> and three widgets: Label Difficulty, User Performance, and User/User Investigation.  The widgets operate as a work-flow, allowing administrators to home in on potential issues.  Currently, the Concordance Tool only provides analysis of boolean labels.  </p>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="concordance-score">Concordance Score<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#concordance-score"></a></h2>
<p>For an article to be considered ‘concordant’ for a given label, every reviewer must agree on that label.  An article is ‘discordant’ for a given label if every reviewer does NOT agree.  The Concordance Score is calculated by summing the number of concordant articles for each label and dividing by the total number of articles with 2+ reviewers for each label.  </p>

The top of every analytics/concordance page measures aggregate label concordance. 94% concordance is considered moderately strong. Over 95% will show a different user message.
</figcaption></figure><p>As an example, the <a href="https://sysrev.com/o/2/p/21696" class="external-link">Mangiferin Data Extraction</a> project has two boolean labels: <code>Include</code> which indicates that an article should be included in downstream analysis and <code>Positive Effect?</code> which asks whether the reviewed paper discusses a beneficial or detrimental effect of mangiferin.</p>
<p>The Mangiferin project has a Concordance Score of 94%.  To calculate this number by hand, take the sum of concordant articles for the <code>Include</code> and <code>Positive Effect</code> labels (106 + 66) and divide by the number of articles that were reviewed by at least two people for each label (116+67).  94% = 172 / 183.</p>
<p>The Concordance Score is meant to go give a quick snapshot of the concordance health of your project.  Values over 95% indicate good health, 90-95% moderate, below 90 may indicate problems in some of your labels.  </p>
</div>
<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="step-1---label-difficulty">Step 1 - Label Difficulty<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#step-1---label-difficulty"></a></h2>
<p>The first widget in the Concordance Tool analyzes which labels are the most difficult for your reviewers. Labels with a large number of discordant labels may be poorly understand by one or more of your reviewers.  </p>
<figure><img src="https://sysrev-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/_posts/blog/content/images/2020/05/image-20.png" class="kg-image" alt='Step 1 - Label Difficulty. Each bar counts the number of articles with 2+ reviewers for the given label. Articles where all reviewers agree are marked "concordant" and otherwise "discordant".'><figcaption aria-hidden="true">
Step 1 - Label Difficulty. Each bar counts the number of articles with 2+ reviewers for the given label. Articles where <strong>all</strong> reviewers agree are marked “concordant” and otherwise “discordant”.
</figcaption></figure><p>For an article to be concordant for a given label, every reviewer must agree on that label.  An article is discordant if every reviewer does NOT agree.  For the Mangiferin project’s <code>Include</code> label, there were 106 Concordant articles and 10 Discordant articles.  </p>
<p>By default, each widgets’ bar charts are set to <code>Count</code>.  Click <code>Percent</code> to view the same graph by percent concordance.  The percent concordance is calculated by dividing the <code>concordant</code> and <code>discordant</code> counts by the total number of articles with 2+ reviewers.</p>
<figure><img src="https://sysrev-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/_posts/blog/content/images/2020/05/image-19.png" class="kg-image" alt="Step 1 Label Concordance with Percent Selected"><figcaption aria-hidden="true">

<div class="section level2">
<h2 id="step-2---user-performance">Step 2 - User Performance<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#step-2---user-performance"></a></h2>
<p>The User Performance widget helps determine which users best understand a given label.  Before viewing the table you must select the label by which to compare users.  Shown below is the widget for the Mangiferin project’s <code>Include</code> label.  Each bar represents a different user who reviewed articles within the project.</p>
<figure><img src="https://sysrev-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/_posts/blog/content/images/2020/05/image-14.png" class="kg-image" alt="User Performance Chart for the Include Label. For each user, the chart shows the number of concordant and discordant articles for a given label."><figcaption aria-hidden="true">
User Performance Chart for the Include Label. For each user, the chart shows the number of concordant and discordant articles for a given label.
</figcaption></figure><p>The User Performance chart shows that user <em>mdongying</em> has reviewed the most articles for inclusion, 10 of which were discordant.  This means that user <em>mdongying</em> disagreed on the <code>Include</code> label with at least one reviewer on 10 articles.  If we take into account data from the Label Difficulty widget, we can discern that <em>mdongying</em> accounts for all of the <code>Include</code> label’s discordant articles.  </p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind, however, that discordance is not the full story.  The discordant articles may represent mistakes by <em>mdongying</em> or by a different reviewer.  Discordance here simply indicates that there is are disagreements between reviewers <code>Include</code> label</p>

<div class="section level1">
<h1 id="step-3---user--user-investigation">Step 3 - User / User Investigation<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#step-3---user--user-investigation"></a></h1>
<p>The final step in the Concordance work-flow is the User / User Investigation widget which analyzes how reviewers compare for a given label.  This step is particularly useful if the project has a trusted reviewer who serves as a good benchmark. This reviewer could be a Project Administrator or simply a reviewer with special expertise.  </p>
<figure><img src="https://sysrev-docs.s3.amazonaws.com/_posts/blog/content/images/2020/05/image-13.png" class="kg-image" alt="Measuring Include user concordance on articles labeled by mdongying"><figcaption aria-hidden="true">
Measuring <code>Include</code> user concordance on articles labeled by <code>mdongying</code>
</figcaption></figure><p>Shown above is the User / User Investigation widget for the Mangiferin Project with the <code>Include</code> label and user <em>mdongying</em> selected<em>.  </em>Each bar represents a user who has reviewed an article which <em>mdongying</em> also reviewed.  For example, user <em>rfa.aliana</em> co-reviewed 58 articles wit <em>mdongying</em> and had perfect concordance.  Meanwhile user <em>hjhjess</em> co-reviewed 27 articles with <em>mdongying,</em> two of which were discordant.  </p>
<p>In this way, the Concordance Tool provides a series of widgets which allow project managers to closely monitor their reviewer performance and label consistency.  The early identification of misunderstood labels or confused reviewers is paramount to the success of any review project.  </p>
<p>We will continue to add new features and tools to the Analytics Dashboard based on user requests.  If you have a suggestions, please send them to use via this <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSebmFD_5X-Dzj8SmEwT_t6T5UkNlM5Cj2n5aLseIl3bNpdO6A/viewform" class="external-link">Google Form</a>.  </p>
