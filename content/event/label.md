Title: Label
---

A label event contains a label definition. The definition is used by labelling steps to assign an [answer](../label-answer/) to a [document](../document/).

Label events follow this format:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "id": "include",
    "question": "Include?",
    "required": false,
    "type": "boolean"
  },
  "hash":"QmdfYCe3UZ1xD39yj1w34EnkqsJtenPjeug7urWMkpUtei",
  "type":"label"
}
```

`data.id` is required. It is a string that allows SRVC to identify past versions of the same label.

`data.question` is required. It is a string that is typically shown to the reviewer as a prompt.

`data.required` is required. It is a boolean that specifies whether a label must be answered for a document, or if the answer may be left blank.

`data.type` is required. It is a string that may be used by labelling steps to determine what form label answers may take.
