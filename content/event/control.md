Title: Control
---

A control event is used when a step needs to communicate with the SRVC software.
It is not saved to `sink.jsonl` unless `sink-all-events` is set to `true`.

There is currently only one kind of control event.
When a step runs a web server, it is used to inform SRVC of the port that the web server is listening on.

Control events follow this format:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "http-port": 31157,
    "timestamp": 1673392440
  },
  "hash":"Qma84opq86nmbXTB5Lgof1wgYLXA9RQe4n9BidmmmyMs4x",
  "type": "control"
}
```
