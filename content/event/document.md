Title: Document
---

A document event contains an article or other data that is to be reviewed.

Document events follow this format:

```json
{
  "data": {"title":"The Beehive Theory"},
  "hash":"QmZp5xnczbBDvAd2ma88Q2bRFkJiKeqxQt9iN6DHc527iR",
  "type":"document",
  "uri":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16999303/"
}
```

The `data` property may be any JSON object.
Labelling and review steps may only understand certain forms of data, and may assign special meaning to certain keys.
Common keys include `title` and `abstract`.

The `uri` property is optional, but it is strongly recommended to assign it whenever a [URI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier) exists.
Steps may provide a link to reviewers based on the `uri`.
The `uri` also helps SRVC to deduplicate documents when there is more than one version of a document's data.
