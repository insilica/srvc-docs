Title: Label Answers
---

A label answer event contains an answer to a [label](../label/) for a particular [document](../document/).

Label answer events follow this format:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "answer": true,
    "document": "QmZp5xnczbBDvAd2ma88Q2bRFkJiKeqxQt9iN6DHc527iR",
    "label": "QmdfYCe3UZ1xD39yj1w34EnkqsJtenPjeug7urWMkpUtei",
    "reviewer": "mailto:user@example.com",
    "timestamp": 1673396981
  },
  "hash":"QmeHHhQu1FFe2T9NHoxpsQmJoeW5aAi8T77HPSJVG47YvD",
  "type":"label-answer"
}
```

All properties are required.

`answer` may be any JSON value that is allowed by the label definition. In this example, `answer` is a boolean value.

`document` is the hash of document that the answer belongs to.

`label` is the hash of the label that is being answered.

`reviewer` is the URI of the reviewer who created the answer.

`timestamp` is a number representing the [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) when the answer was created.
