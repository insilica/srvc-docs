title: Feature Release: Full RIS Import Support
description: Product Release: Sysrev now supports imports using the RIS file format (also known as RefMan) -- the first of many features in our pipeline that will increase Sysrev's versatility in research.

*EDIT* - Click [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_Al2NfIUCw) to
watch a video demonstration of how to use the free reference manager
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) to create Sysrev compatible RIS
documents.

We are excited to announce that Sysrev now supports imports using the
[RIS file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RIS_(file_format)) (also
known as RefMan).  

Our goal at Sysrev is to support any type of review-based research, in
any discipline. Full RIS Import Support is the first of many features in
our pipeline that will increase Sysrev's versatility in research.
 **This post will give a quick overview of the new *Sources* - or
"Import" dashboard.  **

Once a project is created, users are automatically redirected to the
*Sources* dashboard.  Users can also access the dashboard by clicking
*Add/Manage Articles* on the *Articles* dashboard or by clicking
*Manage* from any project dashboard.

The *Sources* dashboard displays the five import mechanisms that Sysrev
currently supports, the newest of which is the .ris file type.
 **Note:** remember to include abstracts when exporting the RIS file.

The other avenues for importing abstracts into Sysrev are uploading an
[Endnote](https://endnote.com/) .xml or a .txt with PubMed IDs.  Unique
to Sysrev, users can search
[PubMed](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) and import abstracts
directly from within the SysRev application.  Also unique to Sysrev,
users can upload a .zip of .pdf's – ***which allows Sysrev users to
review abstracts, full-articles, images, and more.  ***

Our priority is to develop new functionalities that will greatly
increase the usability and versatility of Sysrev as a research tool.  By
supporting RIS files, Sysrev now supports a much larger number of
existing citation and reference management tools including [IEEE
Xplore](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp),
[Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/home.uri),
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/),
[Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/?interaction_required=true), and
many more – which in turn enables Sysrev to support a wider range of
disciplines and research.
