title: Muting the echo chamber

The internet echo chamber polarizes discourse.  When we only read news
that confirms our opinions (no matter how extreme) it is possible for
those opinions to become unanchored from reality.  It's time for
cautious, careful thought to make a comeback.

The academic world also struggles with the echo chamber. When
researchers write papers they look for supporting literature.
 Inevitably, literature search engines like google scholar are employed
in this effort.  While search engines are necessary, they have a biasing
side effect.

An old method has taken on new life in research to combat these biases,
systematic review. In a systematic review, all relevant literature is
collected and curated to extract nuanced information surrounding a
topic.  Sometimes these reviews requires practitioners to screen
thousands of articles.  

A great example of this process is the EntoGEM project at
[sysrev.com/p/16612](http://sysrev.com/p/16612), where researchers are
screening articles on changes in insect populations in order to track
biodiversity trends. The project looks not only at insect declines, but
also increases, lack of changes, and stochasticity in insect population
numbers over time in order to inform policy and management
recommendations. The co-coordinators of the project, Eliza Grames
([@elizagrames](https://twitter.com/ElizaGrames)) and Graham Montgomery
([@sierrawormlion](https://twitter.com/ElizaGrames)), were the first
winners of our mini-grant to support open access review projects.

I love the entogem project because it is a perfect example of taking a
cool-headed approach towards a hot button topic.  Already entogem
reviewers have completed thousands of document reviews.  

Unsolved problems cannot be resolved with a simple google search.  We
need to bring back the careful research methods lauded in a time before
the answer to every question was just a click away.

Here are some more open access projects carefully analyzing the data
behind important questions:

1.  **[Hallmarks and Key Characteristics of
    Cancer](https://sysrev.com/p/3588)**  
    One of the first sysrevs, this [NIEHS](https://www.niehs.nih.gov/)
    project identifies cancer hallmarks, methods, key characteristics,
    and assays in pubmed abstracts.  Cancer hallmarks are one of those
    things with many online references, but to truly know what data
    exists a more careful review is required.    
      
    If you have a strong medical vocabulary you can join this project.
     Just read the overview.  Dr. Alexandre Borrel
    @[AlBorrel](https://twitter.com/AlBorrel) and Dr. Nicole
    Kleinstreuer ([@NKleinstreuer](https://twitter.com/NKleinstreuer))
    started this project.
2.  **[Optimal Human Nutrition](https://sysrev.com/u/1260/p/21422)**  
    Anbe642 ([@EvoPhys](https://twitter.com/EvoPhys)) asks reviewers to
    identify the health effects of various kinds of foods. When it comes
    to confirmation bias, nutrition is a subject where we all have
    weaknesses.  People pick teams for diets (keto? paleo? vegeterian?)
    and find supporting literature.  More careful review of these topics
    is the only way to get yourself out of the echo chamber.  He has
    also made the review free to join, so anybody can join in
    identifying all kinds of nutrition mechanisms.
3.  **[Mangiferin Data Extraction](https://sysrev.com/o/2/p/21696)**  
    Mangiferin is a fascinating compound with activity ranging from
    anti-tumor effects to weight loss.  Studying potential supplements
    can be a tricky subject. It is tempting to google your favorite new
    supplement and read the first positive article.  By carefully
    reviewing all of the studies behind a supplement's health effects,
    we can better understand the strength of evidence. Sysrev just
    started a data extraction study to identify in-vivo experiments
    involving mangiferin.  We extract species, disease, organ,
    administration method, and outcomes for each in vivo experiment.
     All data is readily available for download.  
4.  **[Humanitarian Evidence in Conflict and
    War](https://sysrev.com/u/489/p/16305)**  
    Perhaps the most contentious of human issues is war.  Global
    Evidence Synthesis Initiative
    ([GESI](http://www.gesiinitiative.com/)), another sysrev mini-grant
    winner, runs 7
    [sysrevs](https://sysrev.com/search?q=humanitarian%20evidence&p=1&type=projects)
    extracting information about refugees, migrants, and health from
    grey literature and academic articles.
