Reviewing PDFs on sysrev is easy. Just create the review, and upload a
zip file.

Then type in the name of your project and click "create". </figcaption>

Projects are public by default (which means anybody can see, but not
edit your work). To create a private project, you'll need a <u>Pro
Account</u>. Then just go to `manage → settings → private`. By the way,
you can toggle light or dark mode (dark mode on left) by ****clicking
the lightbulb**** in the upper right.

After creating the project, the
[sources](https://sysrev.com/u/42/p/21848/add-articles) settings page
for that project opens.  To review pdfs simply select 'PDF Files' and
upload a zip directory of your pdfs.

One small caveat.  When you create a public review with pdfs, those pdfs
are hidden from the public.  This is to prevent any copyright issues on
sysrev.  For other users to view your pdfs you must invite them to your
project.

Thats it! From here you can create labels, review articles, invite team
members and do everything else you would do in a review.  We have
