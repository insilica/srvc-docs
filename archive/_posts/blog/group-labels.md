**What is a Group Label?**

Put simply, a *Group Label* is a label-of-labels.  *Group Labels* allow
reviewers to extract multiple sets of information on an as-needed basis.
 

If you imagine labels as the *column headers* in a table, then the
output of most reviews is a table correlating the extracted data to its
source document.  But what happens when a single source document has too
much information for one *row* in the table to capture.  While such
techniques as comma-delimited data are an option, it introduces another
complexity to formatting.  This can be particularly cumbersome in large,
collaborative projects.  

*Group Labels* allows reviewers to extract multiple *rows* of data from
a single source document.  
  
**Creating a Group Label**

The functionality for creating a *Group Label* is a direct extension of
existing label functionality.  Once *Add Group Label* has been selected,
a new label dialogue box will appear.  Within the *Group Label*, users
can create as many *Boolean*, *Categorial*, and *String* labels as the
task requires.  

**Review & Data Extraction**

</figure>

Shown above is a the *Review Dashboard* for Project 31871, which
contains two *Group Labels*: "Health Effects" and "LD50/LC50".  Once a
*Group Label* has been selected, a *Table UI* will appear above the
document.

</figure>

As data is extracted, the *Table* *UI* will automatically update.  In
this way, reviewers are able to see their data in real time, increasing
their ability to fix any irregularities.  Switching between *Group
Labels* will change which *Table* is displayed.

**Data**

Once a document has been reviewed, one can easily look at the data on
the individual article's page.  See how the [demo's extracted
data](https://sysrev.com/o/2/p/31871/article/8296525) compares to a
screenshot of the original MSDS.  Note, you will have to [join the
project](https://sysrev.com/register/aca95ea20922) to see the underlying
PDF.

**Export Options**

Last but not least, utilizing Group labels means that the project data
must be stored in a hierarchical data format. Simply put, since there
are multiple sets of information per document, the data becomes too
complex for a simple table.

To accommodate this, we have developed two Group Labels specific export
options.  First, the JSON export captures all of the project’s data and
preserves the hierarchical structure. Alternatively, you can export
individual Group Labels as CSVs. In our example, this means I can export
the data associated with either the Health Effects OR LD50/LC50 Group
Label, but not both at once.
