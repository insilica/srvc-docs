# Free

Sysrev free allows you to create public projects and invite as many
reviewers as you like.  

Public projects are open access projects that can be found on the web.
 Sysrev frequently posts about exciting public projects.  This is a
great option if you want to do a review and share it with the world, but
public projects are not a good option if your data is private or you
don't want it discovered.

Reviewers are people that you invite to help complete tasks in your
reviews.  As a free user, you can have as many reviewers as you want,
but you can only have one administrator.  Project administrators control
project settings.  

# Pro

Sysrev Pro accounts enable the creation of private projects, access to
sysrev analytics and access to advanced tools like grouped labels.

Sysrev private projects are projects that are not open access.  These
projects can only be viewed by project members which include the project
administrators and reviewers.  Sysrev pro users are limited to one
administrator per project.

Sysrev analytics is a suite of tools to help you analyze your review
results and track progress.

# Enterprise

Sometimes larger teams have special needs.  If you need active,
prioritized support then enterprise is your solution.  Enterprise is
also the best solution if you need a new feature implemented on sysrev.

# Managed Review

One last option not mentioned on our pricing page are managed reviews.
 Sysrev's managed review division can help perform all, or just parts of
your document review process.  Simply contact us at info@sysrev.com to
inquire about this option.
