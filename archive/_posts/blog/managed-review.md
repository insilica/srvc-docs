Do you need to extract and organize data from a large number of
documents?   Sysrev managed reviews handle every stage of document data
extraction:

1.  **Data Source Construction:** Sysrev developers  generate data
    streams from public data, crawling websites, or working with your
    internal data.
2.  **Data Extraction Project Creation:** Sysrev managers will set up
    data extraction projects and work with you to define extraction
    tasks.
3.  **Reviewer Recruitment and Management:** Sysrev will manage expert
    reviewers that can manually perform your data extraction task.  
4.  **Export Review Data:** Sysrev will generate spreadsheet reports or
    integrate review data directly into your own databases.
5.  **Automate Review Tasks:** Many review tasks can be automated.  We
    build machine learning models to automate simple or complex data
    extraction tasks.  
6.  **Analyse Review Data:** Sysrev data scientists can help you derive
    insights from your review. We'll work with you to build actionable
    analytics.  

Sysrev managed reviews are contract services. If you are interested in
